# VHDL Project for Papilio One Audio Wing Sanity Check

This project does the following:

* Generates a couple of square waves, one for each channel
** The fundamental pitch is concert A (440Hz), but the channels have been slightly de-tuned just for fun
* Sends each wave to a Delta-Sigma DAC
* Sends the output of each DAC to a single channel on the Audio Wing
